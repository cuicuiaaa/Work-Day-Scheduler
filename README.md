# Work-Day-Scheduler

The project is a work day scheduler which allows the user to save events for each hour of the day.

## Highlights

The date and time are dynamically updated to show the current day and time.
The saved events persist after the user refreshes the page.
Each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future.
